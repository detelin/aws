# Instance Metadata and User Data<a name="ec2-instance-metadata"></a>

*Instance metadata* is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance\. Instance metadata is divided into categories\. For more information, see [Instance Metadata Categories](#instancedata-data-categories)\.

**Important**  
Although you can only access instance metadata and user data from within the instance itself, the data is not protected by cryptographic methods\. Anyone who can access the instance can view its metadata\. Therefore, you should take suitable precautions to protect sensitive data \(such as long\-lived encryption keys\)\. You should not store sensitive data, such as passwords, as user data\.

You can also use instance metadata to access *user data* that you specified when launching your instance\. For example, you can specify parameters for configuring your instance, or attach a simple script\. You can also use this data to build more generic AMIs that can be modified by configuration files supplied at launch time\. For example, if you run web servers for various small businesses, they can all use the same AMI and retrieve their content from the Amazon S3 bucket you specify in the user data at launch\. To add a new customer at any time, simply create a bucket for the customer, add their content, and launch your AMI\. If you launch more than one instance at the same time, the user data is available to all instances in that reservation\.

EC2 instances can also include *dynamic data*, such as an instance identity document that is generated when the instance is launched\. For more information, see [Dynamic Data Categories](#dynamic-data-categories)\.

## Retrieving Instance Metadata<a name="instancedata-data-retrieval"></a>

Because your instance metadata is available from your running instance, you do not need to use the Amazon EC2 console or the AWS CLI\. This can be helpful when you're writing scripts to run from your instance\. For example, you can access the local IP address of your instance from instance metadata to manage a connection to an external application\.

To view all categories of instance metadata from within a running instance, use the following URI:

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

Note that you are not billed for HTTP requests used to retrieve instance metadata and user data\.

You can use a tool such as cURL, or if your instance supports it, the GET command; for example:

```
[ec2-user ~]$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

```
[ec2-user ~]$ GET http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

You can also download the [Instance Metadata Query tool](https://aws.amazon.com/code/ec2-instance-metadata-query-tool/), which allows you to query the instance metadata without having to type out the full URI or category names\.

All instance metadata is returned as text \(content type `text/plain`\)\. A request for a specific metadata resource returns the appropriate value, or a `404 - Not Found` HTTP error code if the resource is not available\. 

A request for a general metadata resource \(the URI ends with a /\) returns a list of available resources, or a `404 - Not Found` HTTP error code if there is no such resource\. The list items are on separate lines, terminated by line feeds \(ASCII 10\)\. 

### Examples of Retrieving Instance Metadata<a name="instancedata-meta-data-retrieval-examples"></a>

This example gets the available versions of the instance metadata\. These versions do not necessarily correlate with an Amazon EC2 API version\. The earlier versions are available to you in case you have scripts that rely on the structure and information present in a previous version\.

```

### Throttling<a name="instancedata-throttling"></a>

We throttle queries to the instance metadata service on a per\-instance basis, and we place limits on the number of simultaneous connections from an instance to the instance metadata service\. 

If you're using the instance metadata service to retrieve AWS security credentials, avoid querying for credentials during every transaction or concurrently from a high number of threads or processes, as this may lead to throttling\. Instead, we recommend that you cache the credentials until they start approaching their expiry time\. 

If you're throttled while accessing the instance metadata service, retry your query with an exponential backoff strategy\.

## Working with Instance User Data<a name="instancedata-add-user-data"></a>

When working with instance user data, keep the following in mind:
+ User data is treated as opaque data: what you give is what you get back\. It is up to the instance to be able to interpret it\.
+ User data is limited to 16 KB\. This limit applies to the data in raw form, not base64\-encoded form\.
+ User data must be base64\-encoded\. The Amazon EC2 console can perform the base64 encoding for you or accept base64\-encoded input\.
+ User data must be decoded when you retrieve it\. The data is decoded when you retrieve it using instance metadata and the console\.
+ If you stop an instance, modify its user data, and start the instance, the updated user data is not executed when you start the instance\.

### Specify Instance User Data at Launch<a name="specify-user-data-launch"></a>

You can specify user data when you launch an instance\. For more information, see [Launching an Instance Using the Launch Instance Wizard](launching-instance.md) and [Running Commands on Your Linux Instance at Launch](user-data.md)\.

### Modify Instance User Data<a name="modify-user-data-run"></a>

You can modify user data for an instance in the stopped state if the root volume is an EBS volume\. For more information, see [View and Update the Instance User Data](user-data.md#user-data-view-change)\.

### Retrieve Instance User Data<a name="instancedata-user-data-retrieval"></a>

To retrieve user data from within a running instance, use the following URI:

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
```

A request for user data returns the data as it is \(content type `application/octet-stream`\)\. 

This example returns user data that was provided as comma\-separated text:

```
[ec2-user ~]$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
1234,john,reboot,true | 4512,richard, | 173,,,
```

This example returns user data that was provided as a script:

```
[ec2-user ~]$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
```

To retrieve user data for an instance from your own computer, see [User Data and the AWS CLI](user-data.md#user-data-api-cli)

## Retrieving Dynamic Data<a name="instancedata-dynamic-data-retrieval"></a>

To retrieve dynamic data from within a running instance, use the following URI: 

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/
```

This example shows how to retrieve the high\-level instance identity categories:

```
[ec2-user ~]$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/
rsa2048
pkcs7
document
signature
dsa2048
```

For more information about dynamic data and examples of how to retrieve it, see [Instance Identity Documents](instance-identity-documents.md)\.

## Example: AMI Launch Index Value<a name="AMI-launch-index-examples"></a>

This example demonstrates how you can use both user data and instance metadata to configure your instances\. 

Alice wants to launch four instances of her favorite database AMI, with the first acting as master and the remaining three acting as replicas\. When she launches them, she wants to add user data about the replication strategy for each replicant\. She is aware that this data will be available to all four instances, so she needs to structure the user data in a way that allows each instance to recognize which parts are applicable to it\. She can do this using the `ami-launch-index` instance metadata value, which will be unique for each instance\.

Here is the user data that Alice has constructed:

```
replicate-every=1min | replicate-every=5min | replicate-every=10min
```

The `replicate-every=1min` data defines the first replicant's configuration, `replicate-every=5min` defines the second replicant's configuration, and so on\. Alice decides to provide this data as an ASCII string with a pipe symbol \(`|`\) delimiting the data for the separate instances\.

Alice launches four instances using the [run\-instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) command, specifying the user data: 

```
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345678 --count 4 --instance-type t2.micro --user-data "replicate-every=1min | replicate-every=5min | replicate-every=10min"
```

After they're launched, all instances have a copy of the user data and the common metadata shown here:
+ AMI id: ami\-12345678
+ Reservation ID: r\-1234567890abcabc0
+ Public keys: none 
+ Security group name: default
+ Instance type: t2\.micro

However, each instance has certain unique metadata\.


**Instance 1**  

| Metadata | Value | 
| --- | --- | 
| instance\-id | i\-1234567890abcdef0 | 
| ami\-launch\-index | 0 | 
| public\-hostname | ec2\-203\-0\-113\-25\.compute\-1\.amazonaws\.com | 
| public\-ipv4 | 67\.202\.51\.223 | 
| local\-hostname | ip\-10\-251\-50\-12\.ec2\.internal | 
| local\-ipv4 | 10\.251\.50\.35 | 


**Instance 2**  

| Metadata | Value | 
| --- | --- | 
| instance\-id | i\-0598c7d356eba48d7 | 
| ami\-launch\-index | 1 | 
| public\-hostname | ec2\-67\-202\-51\-224\.compute\-1\.amazonaws\.com | 
| public\-ipv4 | 67\.202\.51\.224 | 
| local\-hostname | ip\-10\-251\-50\-36\.ec2\.internal | 
| local\-ipv4 | 10\.251\.50\.36 | 


**Instance 3**  

| Metadata | Value | 
| --- | --- | 
| instance\-id | i\-0ee992212549ce0e7 | 
| ami\-launch\-index | 2 | 
| public\-hostname | ec2\-67\-202\-51\-225\.compute\-1\.amazonaws\.com | 
| public\-ipv4 | 67\.202\.51\.225 | 
| local\-hostname | ip\-10\-251\-50\-37\.ec2\.internal | 
| local\-ipv4 | 10\.251\.50\.37 | 


**Instance 4**  

| Metadata | Value | 
| --- | --- | 
| instance\-id | i\-1234567890abcdef0 | 
| ami\-launch\-index | 3 | 
| public\-hostname | ec2\-67\-202\-51\-226\.compute\-1\.amazonaws\.com | 
| public\-ipv4 | 67\.202\.51\.226 | 
| local\-hostname | ip\-10\-251\-50\-38\.ec2\.internal | 
| local\-ipv4 | 10\.251\.50\.38 | 

Alice can use the `ami-launch-index` value to determine which portion of the user data is applicable to a particular instance\.

1. She connects to one of the instances, and retrieves the `ami-launch-index` for that instance to ensure it is one of the replicants:

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-launch-index
   2
   ```

1. She saves the `ami-launch-index` as a variable:

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ ami_launch_index=`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-launch-index`
   ```

1. She saves the user data as a variable:

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ user_data=`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/`
   ```

1. Finally, Alice uses the cut command to extract the portion of the user data that is applicable to that instance:

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ echo $user_data | cut -d"|" -f"$ami_launch_index"
   replicate-every=5min
   ```

## Instance Metadata Categories<a name="instancedata-data-categories"></a>

The following table lists the categories of instance metadata\.
